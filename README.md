# Cinema-Ticketing-Program-

Customers who arrive at the ticket counter will be shown the list of available seats and they will be asked which Category, Class and ticket quantity for each category they require. After payment has been made, each customer will be issued a ticket showing the Seat No. and other appropriate details. 

All the customers will be served at the ticket counter until all the seats are sold, no more customers, movie started, etc). A Ticket Sales Report will then be produced by then for the management.

Additional features:

1.	Multiple movies selection
Instead of only having one movie a week, TAR Cinemax can now show   three movies a week as this program has the ability to sell and record tickets of different movies.

2.	Seat selection
With this program, users are able to choose a movie seat to their liking.

3.	Snacks selection

4.	Input Validation

5.	Promo code
